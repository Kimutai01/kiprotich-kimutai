          Iâ€™m a full stack developer with a passion for building innovative and
          impactful web applications. With expertise in Elixir, Phoenix
          LiveView, JavaScript, Docker, Jest, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Ruby,
          RSpec, Rails, and Django, I bring ideas to life by delivering
          solutions that drive results. I've led teams, including at 10xbeast,
          where we developed AI powered email marketing software. My portfolio
          includes contributions to a dating app, the Mwamba rugby ticketing
          platform generating over $15,000 in sales, and Mche, an AI
          agricultural tool. Whether building single-page applications or full
          stack solutions, I specialize in crafting scalable and market-specific
          platforms that deliver measurable success.
